Implemented Catmull-Rom Splines with both the Camera and a rendered object.
Added a GUI that allows users to increase/decrease the number of spline points in real time, as well as modify their coordinates and adjust relative speed, all while the spline is active and moving.
Made the program bug free (just try and break it ;) )
Attempted to implement parametrization by arc length and ease in/out; ease in/out was confusing with the many different use cases, while for parametrization by arc length, I implemented some code that is currently non-functioning and was unfortunately unable to complete it due to time constraints.
